‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Custom Image Usage

The project includes my own image for certain elements.
First Page Image Issue

The image inside the "Daily Challenge" section is not available.
Instead, a watermark image has been used as a placeholder.
The shady part below the image is part of the original image, but due to the watermark, it is not visible properly.
